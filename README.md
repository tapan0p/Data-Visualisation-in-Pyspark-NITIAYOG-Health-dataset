# Data-Visualisation-in-Pyspark-NITIAYOG-Health-dataset
This project combines data visualization techniques implemented in PySpark with a web-based interface created using Flask, MongoDB, and React. The project aims to demonstrate various data visualization techniques, including histograms, scatter plots, linear regression, box plots, and line plots, through an interactive web application.

##Features
Histogram: Visualize the distribution of data using histograms.
Scatter Plot: Display the relationship between two variables using scatter plots.
Linear Regression: Perform linear regression analysis and visualize the results.
Box Plot: Explore the distribution of data and detect outliers using box plots.
Line Plot: Visualize trends over time or another continuous variable using line plots.
Technologies Used
PySpark: Used for data processing and analysis.
Flask: Implemented the backend server for serving API requests.
MongoDB: Stored data for the web application.
React: Created the frontend interface for interactive visualization.
